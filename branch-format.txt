Format For Branches:

The main repository should consist of all the subsystems, a testing branch, and the comp ready branch which should just be the master branch in case the repository gets nuked.
Pull requests should be from the respective subsystem because then we will merge all of them into the testing branch.
No dev prefix either.
This serve as the final versions of each subsystems and the transition into the competetion ready branch.
Fork names should be (subsystem)-(Your in real life name) because I will not remember your username.
Very well github trained personnel that have two or more years on the team can use the github.
Both requirements must be met.
